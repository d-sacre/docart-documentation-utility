\section{Icons (\daTestIcon) in Text}
%+++bficons+++
	In comparison to many other word processors, the \productName~Backend allows inclusion of custom icons into the continuous text. It also works for headings, tables, captions and lists. The icons can be either images (png, jpg, pdf), TikZ-Elements and more. There is also a native scalability with font size, as it is demonstrated below with some of the default icons the \productName~Utility ships with. %\\[0.5cm] 
	\begin{daInfoBox}
		For version \productVersion, the authors do not recommend the user to create custom icons and therefore do not provide a how-to-guide.
		The reason being that in one of the next releases, substantial changes will be made to the icons Backend, which should make the icon creation by the
		end user way easier and more consistent.
	\end{daInfoBox}

	The \lstinline$\daTestIcon$ comes in handy if a new font/typeface should be assessed.
	\newline For everyday use,
	\productName~provides a selection of default icons. The icons can be accessed by calling the macro \lstinline[emphstyle={\color{orange}\bfseries},moreemph={icon}]$\daIcon{ICONNAME}$. For example,
	\lstinline[emphstyle={\color{orange}\bfseries},moreemph={icon}]$\daIcon{warning}$ 
	generates an exclamation mark within a yellow triangle \daIcon{warning}. Icons with names containing \enquote{\lstinline$var$} can be scaled manually. For example,  \lstinline[emphstyle={\color{orange}\bfseries},moreemph={icon}]$\daIcon[10pt]{varwrench}$ generates a wrench \daIcon[10pt]{varwrench} of width \mbox{10\,pt}. The table \ref{tab:bf:iconOverview} lists all the currently available icons in \mbox{\productName}~\mbox{\productVersion}.
